# Business Risk Register (Simulated) 
## Business, Governance & Health and Safety (IOSH-aligned)  
**Case Study: Vagabond Photography Ltd**

---

## Overview
This repository contains a **simulated Business Risk Register** created to demonstrate my structured approach to **risk identification, assessment, and mitigation planning** within a small service-based organisation.

The register covers both:
- **Business risks** (financial, operational, legal/compliance, reputational)
- **Health & Safety and environmental/weather-related risks**, reflecting an **IOSH-aligned risk management mindset** suitable for field-based and operational environments.

All data used is **non-production (simulated)** and created solely for **portfolio and demonstration purposes**.

## Snapshot – What This Demonstrates
- **15+ documented risks** across business and Health & Safety categories  
- Risk coverage across:
  - Financial
  - Operational
  - Legal / Compliance
  - Reputational
  - Health & Safety / Environmental
- Use of a **5×5 Probability–Impact risk matrix** (Impact 1–5 × Likelihood 1–5)
- Clear distinction between:
  - **Inherent risk** (before controls)
  - **Residual / controlled risk** (after controls)
- Defined **controls, mitigation actions, owners, and review cycles**
- Realistic **2025 timelines**, reflecting an actively maintained register
- Audit-friendly structure suitable for governance and management review

---

## Context
Small service-based organisations often rely on informal decision-making and lack structured risk documentation. This case study demonstrates how a **repeatable, governance-ready risk register** can improve:

- Risk visibility
- Prioritisation of actions
- Accountability and ownership
- Decision-making at management level

---

## Methodology / Approach
1. Defined core business and Health & Safety risk categories
2. Drafted clear risk statements using a **cause → event → impact** structure
3. Scored risks using a **5×5 Probability–Impact matrix**
4. Documented:
   - Existing controls
   - Additional mitigation actions
   - Risk ownership
   - Review status and review dates
5. Reassessed risks post-controls to identify **residual risk**

---

## Risk Scoring & Colour Coding
The register uses standard risk visualisation to support rapid decision-making:

- 🔴 **Red** – High risk  
  *Immediate action required; work should not proceed without controls*
- 🟡 **Amber / Yellow** – Medium risk  
  *Tolerable with mitigation and ongoing monitoring (ALARP principle)*
- ⚪ **Grey** – Controlled / residual risk  
  *Risk remains but is adequately managed through controls*

This approach aligns with common practice in **IOSH, ISO 31000, COSO ERM, and ERP/SAP governance environments**.

---

## Health & Safety & Environmental Risk Coverage (IOSH-aligned)
The register includes dedicated Health & Safety and environmental risks relevant to field-based operations, including:

- Adverse weather during outdoor work (rain, wind, heat, cold)
- Slips, trips, and falls on location
- Manual handling injuries (equipment transport and setup)
- Heat stress and cold exposure
- Vehicle and journey-related safety risks

Controls reflect practical H&S expectations, such as:
- Site-specific risk assessments
- Stop-work authority and weather thresholds
- Training and safe systems of work
- PPE considerations
- Journey planning and fatigue management
- Review and monitoring of incidents and near misses

---

## Framework Alignment (Referenced)
This simulated register is **inspired by** (but not a formal implementation of):

- **ISO 31000** – Risk management principles (identify, assess, treat, monitor)
- **COSO ERM** – Risk ownership, controls, and governance oversight
- **IOSH / UK HSE principles** – Health & Safety risk management and ALARP

---

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Business and operational risk identification
- Health & Safety risk assessment (IOSH-aligned)
- Risk prioritisation using quantitative scoring
- Control evaluation and residual risk thinking
- Mitigation planning and ownership assignment
- Governance-ready documentation and review cycles
- Clear communication of risk to management and stakeholders

---

## Tools & Formats
- **Microsoft Excel** – Risk register structure, scoring, review tracking
- **Markdown** – Documentation and methodology explanation

No special installation is required. The Excel file can be opened directly to review the full register.

## Relevance to ERP / SAP Environments (Including SAP HANA)
The structure and logic of this register mirror how risks are managed within enterprise environments:

- Risks linked to business areas and operational processes
- Quantified scoring to support prioritisation and reporting
- Control documentation to support audit traceability
- Ownership and review cycles to demonstrate governance maturity

In **SAP-aligned contexts** (including SAP HANA reporting layers and SAP GRC / EHS-style governance), the same principles are used to connect **processes, controls, and reporting** to monitor exposure, manage compliance, and support informed decision-making.
