## Business, Governance & Health and Safety (IOSH-aligned)  
**Case Study: Vagabond Photography Ltd**

---

## Overview
This repository contains a **simulated Business Risk Register** created to demonstrate my structured approach to **risk identification, assessment, and mitigation planning** within a small service-based organisation.

The register covers both:
- **Business risks** (financial, operational, legal/compliance, reputational)
- **Health & Safety and environmental/weather-related risks**, reflecting an **IOSH-aligned risk management mindset** suitable for field-based and operational environments.

All data used is **non-production (simulated)** and created solely for **portfolio and demonstration purposes**.

## Snapshot – What This Demonstrates
- **15+ documented risks** across business and Health & Safety categories  
- Risk coverage across:
  - Financial
  - Operational
  - Legal / Compliance
  - Reputational
  - Health & Safety / Environmental
- Use of a **5×5 Probability–Impact risk matrix** (Impact 1–5 × Likelihood 1–5)
- Clear distinction between:
  - **Inherent risk** (before controls)
  - **Residual / controlled risk** (after controls)
- Defined **controls, mitigation actions, owners, and review cycles**
- Realistic **2025 timelines**, reflecting an actively maintained register
- Audit-friendly structure suitable for governance and management review

## Context
Small service-based organisations often rely on informal decision-making and lack structured risk documentation. This case study demonstrates how a **repeatable, governance-ready risk register** can improve:

- Risk visibility
- Prioritisation of actions
- Accountability and ownership
- Decision-making at management level

## Methodology / Approach
1. Defined core business and Health & Safety risk categories
2. Drafted clear risk statements using a **cause → event → impact** structure
3. Scored risks using a **5×5 Probability–Impact**
