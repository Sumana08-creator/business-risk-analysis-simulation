# Business Risk Analysis – Simulated Case Study (Vagabond Photography Ltd)

## Overview
This repository contains a simulated business risk analysis created to demonstrate my approach to identifying, prioritising, and mitigating risks in a small service-based organisation.

The project uses non-production (simulated) data for demonstration purposes and is designed to be portfolio-ready for business, governance, and ERP/SAP-aligned roles.

## Snapshot (What I Did)
- Identified **10 key risks** across **4 business areas** (Financial, Operational, Legal/Compliance, Reputational)
- Applied a **5×5 Probability–Impact risk matrix** to prioritise risks
- Documented **current controls**, **proposed mitigation actions**, **ownership**, and **status tracking**
- Produced an audit-friendly risk register format suitable for management review

## Context
Small service businesses often have informal processes and limited documentation of operational and financial risks. This case study demonstrates a structured, repeatable method to improve risk visibility and decision-making.

## Approach
1. Defined core business areas and common risk categories
2. Drafted risk statements in clear business language (cause → event → impact)
3. Scored risks using a **5×5 Probability–Impact matrix** (Impact 1–5 × Likelihood 1–5)
4. Captured:
   - Current controls
   - Mitigation plan
   - Risk owner
   - Status (Open / In Progress / Mitigated / Reviewing)

## Key Output (Artifacts)
 - **Business Risk Register (PNG)**: [View the Simulated Business Risk Register](./Simulated_Business_Risk_Register.png)


**Deliverables included**
- Visual risk register (PNG)
- README methodology + assumptions (this file)

## Framework Alignment (Referenced)
This demonstration is **inspired by** common risk management practices (not a formal implementation) including:
- **ISO 31000** (risk management principles: identify → assess → treat → monitor)
- **COSO ERM** concepts (risk ownership, controls, and governance visibility)

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Risk identification & assessment (business-focused risk statements)
- Prioritisation using a probability–impact scoring model
- Mitigation planning and ownership assignment
- Business continuity thinking (operational resilience)
- Structured documentation and management-ready reporting
- Clear communication of risk in an audit-friendly format

## Technologies / Tools
- Spreadsheet-style risk register format (Excel-style structure)
- Markdown documentation (GitHub README)

> Note: This repo does not require special software. The artifact is provided as an image for easy viewing.

## How to View / Use
- Open the register directly in GitHub:  
  **`Business_Risk_Register.png`** → click to zoom
- To reuse the structure:
  - Copy the columns into Excel/Google Sheets
  - Add/modify risks and update scores (Impact × Likelihood)

## Relevance to ERP / SAP Environments (Including SAP HANA)
The risk register structure used here mirrors how risks are managed in ERP contexts:
- Risks are linked to business areas and processes (sales, delivery, invoicing)
- Risks are scored and prioritised to support governance decisions
- Controls, ownership, and mitigation actions provide traceability for audits

In SAP-aligned environments (including SAP HANA reporting layers and GRC-style governance), the same logic is used to connect **business processes, controls, and reporting** so leadership can monitor exposure, prioritise mitigation, and demonstrate compliance with internal policies and external requirements.
