# Business Risk Analysis – Simulated Case Study

## Overview
This repository contains a simulated business risk analysis created to demonstrate my approach to identifying, prioritising, and mitigating risks in a small service-based organisation.

The project is based on a realistic business scenario and uses non-production data for demonstration purposes.

## Context
- Organisation type: Small service business
- Focus: Operational, financial, legal, and reputational risks
- Objective: Improve visibility of key business risks and support structured decision-making

## Approach
1. Identified core business areas (financial, operational, compliance, reputational)
2. Documented key risks affecting business continuity and performance
3. Applied an impact × likelihood scoring model
4. Proposed practical mitigation actions and ownership

## Key Output
- Business Risk Register (simulated example)

## Relevance to ERP / SAP environments
The structured risk register, scoring logic, and mitigation tracking demonstrated here align with enterprise risk management practices commonly implemented within ERP systems such as SAP, where business processes, controls, and reporting are integrated to support governance and decision-making.
